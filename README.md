## Project Description 
This project is on creating a simple and user friendly inspirational Quote Generator app.

This is a beginner level project and its main aim is to intergrate the 3 pillars of front-end web-development i.e *html, css and javascript* so as to create a simple but functional and interactive web application. The application should also access data from a public API.

It is also a part of the requirement so as to graduate to phase 2 of the moringa/flatiron school curriculum.
