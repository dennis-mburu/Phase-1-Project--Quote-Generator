# Phase-1-Project--Quote-Generator

## Author
This Project was Created and Edited by **Dennis Mburu Mwaura** 

## Project Description 
This project is on creating a simple and user friendly inspirational Quote Generator app.

This is a beginner level project and its main aim is to intergrate the 3 pillars of front-end web-development i.e *html, css and javascript* so as to create a simple but functional and interactive web application. The application should also access data from a public API.

It is also a part of the requirement so as to graduate to phase 2 of the moringa/flatiron school curriculum. 

## Project Setup Instructions
This is sort of a "Plug and Play" kind of project, in that no extra software or hardware is required. You can Use the  Live link provided below on any device to access the finished product.
However, for best experience in viewing or editing the code, you may need a code editor, which can be of your own choosing.
If you are unsure of which code editor to use, I recommend visual studio code which is what was used to create this whole project.
